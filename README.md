# Mission Statement

Project mission statement: TODO
We have hit the crossroads of civilization, a potential easter island story. Do we cut our last tree, drain our last river , poison our atmosphere and ocean, for the sake of short term financial profits for a corpoation and its share holders. There must be more relevant human prosperity indictators. We should be able to see if more people are happy, if the environment is becoming healthier, if the ecology is becoming healthier, if more people have access to nutritious food and healing medicines. 
 Its also a time where ingenuity, technology and economic wealth are abundant, yet we have been stuck in an outmodeled paradigm that only acknoledges economic profit, at a detriment to most of our society and environment.   
 Its time that we start identifying the challenges that face humanity and collaborate together to solve them.  We are at a time where technology is advancing beyond our wildest expectations. We are a society of linked in and connected people.  We have the creativity and technology to create something more beautiful than any one of us could imagine. So lets  aim high  and imagine and create something better. Its the time of bringing all the individual puzzle pieces together, to creat a clear and holistic vision. It's the time to open up the playing field to members of all the various disiplines to create a new symphony of creation. To open souce the information, so any one can improve and share it for benifit of human kind. To create an abundance that enriches all of us including our environment. 
 An  important milestone for us is the point of free enegy, when we achieve that , the possibilities of food production in deserts and frozen climates become achievable. Poverty can then start the path to prosperity for many in regions that are currently considered unarable . 
 What happens when we bring together the various disiplines of the world, engineers, computer programmers, permaculturists, chemists, economists, ecologists, therapist, health professionals, communication experts, idustrial designers, architects, robotics & automation designers, educators, nutritionists, biologists and systems specialists and you give them the task of coming up with the most effient human system to creat possibilities and prosperity for the whole. We dont know yet but it makes for exciting times, the ideas and possibilities open up. The brightest minds coming together for the betterment of society and all of a sudden everything is possible.
